# 🧠 Pneumonia Detection with Deep Learning

This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. It includes model evaluation, interpretability via Grad-CAM, and training analysis.

---

## 🔍 Project Highlights
- Binary classification using CNN
- Grad-CAM overlays for visual interpretability
- Evaluation with confusion matrix, ROC curve, and classification report
- Training history visualization (18 epochs)

---

## 📁 Files Included
- `Final_Project_DeepLearning_RKG.ipynb`: Full notebook with code, outputs, and explanations
- `pneumonia_model_35.keras`: Trained model
- `history_18_epoch.pkl`: Training history for plotting
- `gradcam_audit/`: Grad-CAM overlays for NORMAL and PNEUMONIA
- `presentation.pdf`: Final presentation slides

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Open `Final_Project_DeepLearning_RKG.ipynb` in Jupyter
3. Run cells sequentially (model already trained)
4. View evaluation metrics and Grad-CAM visualizations
